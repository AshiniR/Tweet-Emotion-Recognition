# üìù Tweet Emotion Recognition

 DAIR AI Emotion Dataset 
üß†# Introduction
Understanding emotions expressed in text is a key challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on Tweet Emotion Recognition ‚Äî automatically classifying tweets into six emotion categories using a variety of models ranging from traditional machine learning to advanced transformer-based architectures.

* The project experiments with multiple models:
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)
* BLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)
* DistilBERT
* BERT
* RoBERTa

The objective is to compare their performance on emotion detection tasks and identify the most effective model for real-world applications.

üéØ# Objectives

* Preprocess and clean tweet text data (remove mentions, links, hashtags, and emojis).
* Train and evaluate multiple models for emotion classification.
* Fine-tune transformer-based models (DistilBERT, BERT, RoBERTa) for multi-class emotion recognition.
* Address class imbalance using weighted loss functions and weighted metrics.
* Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Save the best-performing models for deployment.
